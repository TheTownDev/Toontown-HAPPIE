# Toontown AP World Source Code

This directory contains everything you need to generate a Toontown game using Archipelago.

You can use the `make_apworld.bat` script to generate the apworld file required to generate games that support 
Toontown locally.

This is the source responsible for the generation logic, item placement, logic rules, and definitions for
everything Archipelago needs to know about our game (items, locations, regions, and access rules).
