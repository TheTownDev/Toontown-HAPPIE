# Toontown: Happie!
Welcome to the repository of the Archipelago version of the Toontown!

This source is built on the foundation of Toontown Archipelago! If you have not checked out Toontown Archipelago before, It's a amazing toontown project that built alot of the systems that are being used for Toontown Happie!

# Offline Info
This source code is based on a March 2019 fork of Toontown Offline v1.0.0.0 used for Toontown School House. 
It has been stripped of all Toontown Offline exclusive features, save one. The brand new Magic Words system made for 
Toontown Offline has been left alone, and upgraded to the most recent build. This feature will allow users to easily navigate around Toontown without any hassle.

# Getting Started
Running this source is simular to running Toontown: Archipelago, except is without the actual Archipelago needs!
The Releases Section will have the needed files to run the game.
